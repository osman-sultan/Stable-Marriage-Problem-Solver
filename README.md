# Stable-Marriage-Problem-Solver

A fun implementation of the Gale-Shapley algorithm to solve the famous Stable Marriage Problem (SMP) using vanilla Java and OOP fundementals. 

This approach imagines SMP in a relatable context where students and schools represent the suitors and receivers (or vice versa). 

This program includes an indepth user-friendly CLI to provide the user with statistics and easy manipulation of the data. 

Provided in this repository are sample datasets of upto 2000 participants, formatted in a specific manor, with sample test cases to support the robust nature of the scripts. However, feel free to develop your own datasets and inputs when running the program! 

On the off chance you find a bug, let me know :)
